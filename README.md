# Mobile Manipulator Lab Notebooks
These Python Jupyeter notebooks are designed for academic teaching laboratories in robotics, using Gazebo for simulation up to physical deployment on robotic platforms. The students are not expected to install or deploy the required ROS workspace on their personal computer, but rather use a server infrastructure at the university. The laboratories were designed at École de technologie supérieure, in Montréal, Canada, where we host the physical infrastructure to which these tools are tailored. We have 8 robotic platforms for the students to test their algorithms and several shared desktop stations. The stations are accessible remotely.
