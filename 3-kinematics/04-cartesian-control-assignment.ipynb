    "The goal of this assignment is to implement a Cartesian controller for the kinova gen3 lite arm. The controller should take a desired end-effector pose and compute the joint velocities that will move the end-effector to the desired pose. The controller should be implemented as a ROS node and should be able to receive the desired end-effector pose from a topic."
