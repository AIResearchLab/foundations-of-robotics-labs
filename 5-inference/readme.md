# Inference

In computer science, `machine learning` is a field of study that focuses on the ability of computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a subset of `artificial intelligence`, which is the study of how to make computers intelligent. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on data, and then use that model to make predictions or decisions. `Inference` is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data.

Inference is a key stage in many machine learning applications. For example, in a computer vision application, inference takes place when an algorithm is given an image and generates a caption describing the image. Inference is also used in applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
